## 🧪 Technical Details

### Machine Learning Models

The system uses two ensemble methods for bloom prediction:
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Primary model for risk categorization
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Alternative model for interpretability

**Features Used** (avoiding target leakage):
- Waterbody area (km²)
- Average depth (m)
- Number of pollution sources
- Month of year
- Seasonal factors
- Temperature factors
- Nutrient loading index
- Historical bloom frequency
- Water quality grade

**Predictions**:
- Risk category (Low/Medium/High)
- Bloom probability (0-1)
- Future algae coverage percentage
- Confidence intervals

### Spectral Indices

1. **NDVI** (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
   - Formula: (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)
   - Range: -1 to 1 (higher = more vegetation)

2. **NDWI** (Normalized Difference Water Index)
   - Formula: (Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)
   - Range: -1 to 1 (higher = more water)

3. **Chlorophyll-a**
   - Indicator of algae concentration
   - Measured in μg/L

4. **Turbidity**
   - Water clarity indicator
   - Measured in NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units)

5. **FAI** (Floating Algae Index)
   - Detects surface algae blooms
   - Formula: NIR - (Red + (SWIR - Red) × factor)

### Risk Assessment Algorithm

Risk score is calculated using:
```
risk_score = (
    0.35 × normalized_algae_coverage +
    0.35 × normalized_chlorophyll +
    0.20 × turbidity_factor +
    0.10 × seasonal_factor
)
```

Risk levels:
- **Low**: score < 0.3
- **Medium**: 0.3 ≤ score < 0.6
- **High**: score ≥ 0.6
