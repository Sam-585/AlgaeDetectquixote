Uttarakhand Waterbodies Database
Contains verified geographic information about major water bodies in Uttarakhand region for algae monitoring

NOTE: This dataset contains ONLY real, verifiable information:
- Geographic coordinates (verified real locations)
- Waterbody names and types
- Management authorities

All analysis data (blooms, water quality, etc.) comes from real-time satellite imagery via Google Earth Engine.
NO simulated, assumed, or historical fabricated data is included.
